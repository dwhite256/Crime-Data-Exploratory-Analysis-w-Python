## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project will utilize python and different libraries within python such as pandas to explore and create visualizations for a dataset with different crime statistics. Multiple questions about the data will be answered using exploratory analysis.

## DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA
The data used in this project contains crime data about type of crime comitted, the description of the crime, the time of the crime, the district the crime took place in, and the date of the crime.

## DATA ANALYSIS PROCESS
The appropriate python libraries had to be loading into the Kaggle notebook to perform exploratory analysis on the dataset and create the plots from the results of the python code. The proper encoding had to be incorporated into the code in order to read in the csv file, otherwise the analysis could not be conducted because the default encoding is not compatible. Exploratory analysis was used to provide the data driven answers to different questions regarding the dataset. The code in the kaggle notebook contains descriptive comments to make it easy to follow along and understand the code.

## CONCLUSION
After conducting exploratory analysis on the dataset, the data shows that:
* The most common offenses were motor vehicles accidents.
* The least common offenses were burglaries where no property was taken, human trafficking, and biological threat.
* The most common offense descriptions were medical.
* The most crimes in a year were comitted in 2017.
* Most of the time, crimes are comitted on Fridays in the evenings between 4-6 pm.
* The avereage number of crimes per month was 7,976.
* The months with the highest average number of crimes by year were September in 2015, August in 2016 and 2017, and May in 2018.
* The district where the most crimes were comitted on a yearly basis was district B2.
* Average number of crimes per district by was 6,610.
* The analysis also shows the months, districts, and years where the number of crimes were below average.
