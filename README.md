## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
This project will utilize python and different libraries within python such as pandas to explore and create visualizations from the values of a dataset with different crime statistics. Multiple questions about the data will be answered by using exploratory analysis.

## DATA ANALYSIS PROCESS
The appropriate python libraries had to be loading into the notebook to perform exploratory analysis on the dataset and create the plots from the results of the python code. The proper encoding had to be incorporated into the code in order to read in the csv file, otherwise the analysis could not be conducted because the default encoding is not compatible. Exploratory analysis is conducted to give data driven answers to different questions regarding the dataset. The code in the kaggle notebook contains descriptive comments to make it easy to follow along and understand what the code is doing.

## CONCLUSION
All questions were able to answered after conducting exploratory analysis on the crime dataset. The results of the analysis 
The data shows that the most common offenses are motor vehicles accidents. The least common offenses are burlaries where no property was taken, human trafficking, and biological threat. The most common offense descriptions are medical. The most crimes in a year were comitted in 2017. The time of the day that the majority of crime is comitted is in the evening between 4-6 pm. Most of the time, crimes are comitted on Fridays in the evenings between 4-6 pm. The avereage number of crimes. Months with the highest average number of crimes by year. Months where the number of crimes were below average. Districts where the most crimes were comitted on a yearly basis. Average number of crimes per district.
