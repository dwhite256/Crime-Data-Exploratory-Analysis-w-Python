## DATA ANALYSIS PROCESS
The appropriate python libraries had to be loading into the notebook to perform exploratory analysis on the dataset and create the plots from the results of the python code. The proper encoding had to be incorporated into the code in order to read in the csv file, otherwise the analysis could not be conducted because the default encoding is not compatible. Exploratory analysis is conducted to give data driven answers to different questions regarding the dataset. The code in the kaggle notebook contains descriptive comments to make it easy to follow along and understand what the code is doing.
